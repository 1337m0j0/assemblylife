# Assembly Life

The experiments in this repository aim to explore what digital life could look like.

The following definition of life from Wikipedia shall be used as a starting point:
**matter that can reproduce itself and evolve as survival dictates** ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life#Definitions))

Based on this, two questions shall be investigated:
* What could reproduction look like on an assembly level?
* What could evolution look like on an assembly level?


## Setup

### Technology

* aarch64
* qemu
* tinycore linux

### Documentation

### Development Cycle

* design
* develop
* build
* run
* inspect


## Experiments

* Can a program write itself to disk from memory alone?
* Can a program evolve to use the correct assembly command in one position?
* What memory layout would give some robustness against random byte-mutation?
